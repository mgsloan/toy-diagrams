toy-diagrams
============

toy-diagrams provides a few widgets for interactive diagrams - things like
buttons / handles / sliders - as well as ways to combine these interactive
diagrams together.These are implemented in a backend / vectorspace agnostic
fashion, allowing the same code to possibly be used in multiple contexts.

Why "toy"?
----------

The name \"toy\" comes from the \"toy framework\", a part of the
[lib2geom](http://lib2geom.sourceforge.net) library. It's used in building
"toys" demonstrating the features of the library.  This is a different variety
of "TDD" - but instead of tests, it's toys! We found that building little demos
to be a nice way to drive initial design / development.

Installation
------------

If you want to build the latest repository versions of the toy packages, use
[toy-sources](https://github.com/mgsloan/toy-sources), or manually fetch /
build the repositories.
